  ~ OWASP Top 10 Report

  ~  Overview  ~

The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the most critical web application security risks. Understanding these risks helps developers, security professionals, and organizations secure their applications against common vulnerabilities.

TryHackMe provides practical labs and exercises to help users understand and mitigate each risk, simulating real-world attacks and remediation techniques.



    ~ OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities ~

1.   ~  ~Injection (A01:2021)  ~  
     ~Description  ~  ~: Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, and OS command injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.
     ~Example  ~  ~: SQL Injection, where attackers can manipulate database queries to gain unauthorized access.
     ~Mitigation  ~  ~: Use parameterized queries, prepared statements, and proper validation.
     ~TryHackMe Exercises  ~  ~: The   ~SQL Injection  ~ room demonstrates how to identify and exploit SQLi vulnerabilities and how to secure applications.

2.    ~Broken Authentication (A02:2021)  ~  
    ~Description  ~  ~: Insecure authentication allows attackers to compromise passwords, session tokens, or keys to assume other users' identities.
    ~Example  ~  ~: Brute-forcing weak passwords to access user accounts.
    ~Mitigation  ~  ~: Implement strong password policies, use multi-factor authentication, and limit login attempts.
  ~TryHackMe Exercises  ~  ~: The   ~Authentication  ~ room covers the importance of secure authentication mechanisms.

3.   ~Sensitive Data Exposure (A03:2021)  ~  
     ~Description  ~  ~: Sensitive data exposure occurs when applications do not adequately protect sensitive information.
     ~Example  ~  ~: Exposing personal or financial data through unencrypted connections.
    ~Mitigation  ~  ~: Use strong encryption (TLS) and secure storage practices.
     ~TryHackMe Exercises  ~  ~: The   ~OWASP Top 10  ~ room has tasks focusing on how sensitive data might be exposed.

4.    ~XML External Entities (XXE) (A04:2021)  ~ 
     ~Description  ~  ~: XXE flaws occur when XML parsers allow external entity references, leading to data exposure or remote code execution.
     ~Example  ~  ~: Exploiting XML parsers to read files on a server.
     ~Mitigation  ~  ~: Disable external entity processing in XML parsers, use less risky data formats.
     ~TryHackMe Exercises  ~  ~: The   ~XXE  ~ room shows examples and mitigation steps for XXE vulnerabilities.

5.   ~  ~Broken Access Control (A05:2021)  ~ 
     ~Description  ~  ~: Inadequate access controls let unauthorized users access restricted data or functions.
     ~Example  ~  ~: Elevating privileges to access restricted areas of an application.
    ~Mitigation  ~  ~: Enforce role-based access control (RBAC), restrict administrative functions.
     ~TryHackMe Exercises  ~  ~: The   ~Access Control  ~ room demonstrates practical examples of bypassing weak access controls.

6  ~Security Misconfiguration (A06:2021)  ~ 
 ~Description  ~  ~: Security misconfiguration occurs when security settings are left at insecure defaults.
  ~Example  ~  ~: Default accounts and passwords on systems.
  ~Mitigation  ~  ~: Regularly update and review configurations, remove unnecessary services.
    ~TryHackMe Exercises  ~  ~: The   ~Basic Pentesting  ~ room covers finding and exploiting misconfigurations.

7.     ~Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (A07:2021)  ~  
       ~Description  ~  ~: XSS flaws occur when untrusted data is included in web pages without proper validation.
       ~Example  ~  ~: Injecting JavaScript into a page to steal cookies or perform actions on behalf of the user.
       ~Mitigation  ~  ~: Use output encoding, input validation, and content security policies (CSP).
      ~TryHackMe Exercises  ~  ~: The   ~Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  ~ room shows how to exploit XSS and prevent it.

8.     ~Insecure Deserialization (A08:2021)  ~  
       ~Description  ~  ~: Insecure deserialization can lead to remote code execution if untrusted data is deserialized.
        ~Example  ~  ~: Sending malicious serialized data to a web application.
        ~Mitigation  ~  ~: Avoid deserializing untrusted data, implement integrity checks.
        ~TryHackMe Exercises  ~  ~: The   ~Serialization  ~ room illustrates the dangers of insecure deserialization.

9.      ~ Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities (A09:2021)  ~  
        ~Description  ~  ~: Applications relying on vulnerable components risk being compromised.
        ~Example  ~  ~: Using outdated libraries with known exploits.
        ~Mitigation  ~  ~: Regularly update dependencies, monitor for known vulnerabilities.
       ~TryHackMe Exercises  ~  ~: The   ~Vulnerable Software  ~ room covers identifying and mitigating component vulnerabilities.

10.    ~Insufficient Logging and Monitoring (A10:2021)  ~ 
       ~Description  ~  ~: Without logging and monitoring, attacks go undetected, impacting the response to breaches.
       ~Example  ~  ~: Missing audit logs allow attackers to stay undetected.
       ~Mitigation  ~  ~: Implement logging and alerting systems, monitor logs actively.
       ~TryHackMe Exercises  ~  ~: The   ~Monitoring and Logging  ~ room offers insights into identifying issues through logs.
